# Project Overview

## Project Name

Drink Buddy

## Project Description

Being a bartender can be hard to remember all of those drink recipes. Even harder is trying to find a book that does not have hundreds of recipes you will never use and takes too long to search through.
Need to add your own recipe or a customer favorite? Feel free to add your own recipes and build the database of quality actually used drink recipes.

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

## Component Hierarchy

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: Background knowledge on the topic

### Weaknesses: Airtable. Also combining API's that are searchable and able to add to them.

### Opportunities: Being able to expand my React knowledge and experimenting on my own.

### Threats: Time. I plan to use some time reading more about React and its capabilities and best ways to maximize its use.

## Code Showcase:

### I was particularly proud of the code below because:

```
~~~~~The code goes HERE~~~~~~~
